# CS-100

## About
This repository holds most of the code I wrote during my Computer Science 100 class at the University of Alabama.
All the code is written and tested in C17, and most if not all the code should work in C99. The repository has all the 
labs, projects, and exams we wrote throughout the year. Some Zybooks homework and work we did in class are also 
included in the repository.
